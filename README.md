# Char-Counter
### Creating a simple Char Counter using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

In this project, I wanted to create a char counter. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular JavaScript library called jQuery.
By default, the character limit is 20. However, users can update this limit to 50 or 100 if they want. After you start typing something, if you exceed the limit, you will see that the background color of the area has changed. </br> 
You can click on the link below to experience the application better. Feel free to share your observations with me.
